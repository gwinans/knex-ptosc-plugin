General Instructions:

- Use America/Phoenix as the timezone to get the date.
- Increment the package.json version if code changes are made. Do not increment the version if only documentation was updated.

README.md instructions:

- Ensure the README.md is always up to date with any changes.
- Ensure the examples have at least one option set.

CHANGELOG.md Instruction:

- Add all changes to the changelog, except for updates to the README.md
- Each change is placed under its bolded version as a list item.
- The date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- If the date is found/matched, insert the new package version (if there is one)
  in bold below the date, then add each change under the bolded version as a
  list item.
- If the date is NOT found, add a new date header and insert a bolded version
  and changes under that as a list item.
